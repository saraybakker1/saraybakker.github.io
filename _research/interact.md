## About the project
During my PhD, I am part of the ERC-project INTERACT. 
INTERACT aims to equip mobile robots with the ability to navigate and operate safely in human-populated environments. Leveraging advancements in motion planning, multi-robot task assignment, and machine learning, this project seeks to overcome the challenges of modeling intuition and ensuring safety in complex, uncertain settings.
